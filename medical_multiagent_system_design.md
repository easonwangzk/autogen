# Medical Multi-Agent System Design

## Implementation Approach

### 1. GPT API Integration Design
- Use OpenAI GPT-4 API for all agents with different system prompts
- Implement intelligent prompt engineering for each agent role
- Cache common responses to reduce API calls
- Use streaming responses for better user experience
- Implement rate limiting and retry mechanisms

### 2. Agent Communication Pattern
- Event-driven architecture using pub/sub pattern
- Asynchronous message queue for agent communication
- State management using Redux for frontend
- WebSocket for real-time communication

### 3. System Components
- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS for UI
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: MongoDB for user data and chat history
- Redis for caching and session management
- AWS S3 for data backup

### 4. Key Technologies
- OpenAI GPT API
- Socket.io for real-time communication
- JWT for authentication
- Express Rate Limiter
- MongoDB Atlas
- Redis Cache

### 5. Security Measures
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- HIPAA compliance implementation
- Regular security audits
- Data anonymization

## Anything UNCLEAR
1. Maximum concurrent users limit per API key
2. Specific medical knowledge base source
3. Emergency situation handling protocol
